# WAR - The Card Game

This program simulates a game of war with two players. Based on and heavily influenced by Udemy's [2020 Complete Python Bootcamp From Zero to Hero in Python](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-python-bootcamp/)

## Running the game

In a terminal, run:

    - python ./main.py

As an added option, you can change the 'War Modifier'. The War Modifier is the amount of cards that each player has to draw when a 'WAR' is triggered. By increasing the War Modifier the game will end sooner. By defauly the War Modifier is set to 5.

    - python ./main.py [WAR_MODIFIER]
